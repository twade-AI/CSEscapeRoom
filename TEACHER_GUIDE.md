# 👩‍🏫 Teacher Answer Key

Full solutions for every room. Pupils unlock each door with the **key** earned in
the previous room. Turn on **Teacher mode** (corridor screen) to get a *Reveal*
button inside any room during a live demo.

> **Randomised route:** the starting room and the order are shuffled per device,
> so each group's path differs. The keys below are what **each room awards**; the
> room that key opens depends on that device's route. The game is won once **all
> nine rooms** are solved (the Grey Room cipher reveals the final challenge).

> **"Shuffle puzzle layouts" (⚙ Settings, on by default):** the *answers below are
> always correct*, but the **presentation varies per device** to stop copying —
> anagram letters are re-jumbled, the elimination distractors change, the spot-the-error
> monitors are re-ordered, ASCII codes flip between denary/hex, and the cipher uses a
> random shift (the decoded message is still the same). The **sudoku code stays
> `158399`**. Turn it off for an identical experience on every device. Use a room's
> **👁 Reveal** (Teacher mode) to see a specific device's live answer, or **🖨 Print
> answer key** from the corridor.

> **Settings & tools:** ⚙ (top-right) sets the timer, difficulty (hint budget),
> sound, team name and which rooms are included. **Teacher mode** is
> **password-protected** (so pupils can't reveal answers) — once unlocked it adds
> *Reveal*, *Skip* and *Print answer key*. The win screen offers a printable
> **certificate**. *(The password is stored only as a hash in `js/engine.js`; change
> `TEACHER_HASH` there to set your own.)*

> Tip: keys are **not** case-sensitive and spaces are ignored, so `158399` and
> `Network` both work fine at the locks.
